Developer notes / checklist:
- Replace SystemClock_Config and MX_* functions with CubeIDE generated ones (or copy them into project).
- Implement real camera SCCB init and sensor register writes for your specific camera.
- Configure DCMI + DMA in CubeMX to enable double-buffer mode and link the IRQ to on_frame_captured.
- When integrating TFLM:
  * Add TFLM sources or use STM32Cube AI / X-CUBE-MODELS if available.
  * Prefer CMSIS-NN optimized ops for speed on Cortex-M7.
  * Measure RAM usage and increase tensor_arena accordingly.
